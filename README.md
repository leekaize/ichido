# Ichido (一度)

Ichido is a minimalist, distraction-free web app for writing down your thoughts.

The name comes from **`ichido` (一度)**, the Japanese word for "once" or "one time". This reflects the core philosophy of the app: to encourage a continuous, forward-only flow of thought, capturing a draft in a single, uninterrupted session.

## Core Philosophy

*   **Focus on Flow:** The interface is designed to be invisible. You can only see the last two lines you've typed, preventing you from over-editing and encouraging you to keep moving forward.
*   **Immutable Past:** Once a word is completed (by pressing space), it turns grey and becomes uneditable. This frees you from the temptation to constantly revise and helps you stay in the present moment of writing.
*   **Seamless Experience:** Every word is automatically saved to your browser's local storage. There is no save button to distract you. Start a new draft when you're ready, and find all your past thoughts in the archives.

## Features

*   **Minimalist, Invisible Interface:** The entire page is your canvas.
*   **Forward-Only Writing:** Completed words cannot be edited or deleted.
*   **Automatic Saving:** Every word is synced to a persistent draft.
*   **Simple Archive System:** Access, copy, or delete all your previous drafts.
*   **Theme Toggler:** Switch between Light, Dark, and Auto (system) modes for comfort.
*   **Keyboard-Centric Design:** No cursor movement, no "Enter" key, just pure typing.
*   **Zero Dependencies:** Runs entirely in the browser with no need for a backend or installation.
